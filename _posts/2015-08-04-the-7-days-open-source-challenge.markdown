Last Wednesday I gave a lightning talk about open source at the [Buenos Aires Ruby Meetup](http://www.meetup.com/rubyba/events/223814545/). I proposed a challenge to all attendees: Contribute to one (or many) open source projects for 7 days straight.

The rules are simple:

* You have to do it for 7 days straight
* If you can't do it one day, that breaks your streak
* When you break your streak, you have to start over from day 1

The goal of this challenge is to **make contributing to open source projects a habit**.

You can see the slides over here:

I did this challenge because I wanted to get back to contributing to a couple of projects that I currently maintain. It was great and I finally made some progress in [DatabaseCleaner](https://github.com/DatabaseCleaner/database_cleaner/)

I hope that this challenge will encourage other developers to start contributing to their favorite projects.

Here are a couple of ways that you can contribute to open source:

* Submit a new issue to a library. Make sure that it hasn't been reported yet. If it has, add meaningful information to the issue to make it easier to solve it
* Try to solve an existing issue. Find the lines of code that are causing the problem and submit a pull request
* If you can't solve it, write a failing scenario in the library's test suite
* Improve documentation where it's unclear or non-existent

If you don't know where to begin, check out [http://www.codetriage.com](http://www.codetriage.com/) or ping me (I'm one of the maintainers of [DatabaseCleaner](https://github.com/DatabaseCleaner/database_cleaner/) and [EmailSpec](https://github.com/bmabey/email-spec) and I'd appreciate your help)
