We recently worked on a series of Christmas presents for the team. We are happy to share part of the process and its final result!

### Our process: it all started with an idea

As it happens with every product, it starts with an idea. We wanted to make a t-shirt, a notebook and a tote bag that could reflect our passion for work and design.

For the notebook, we chose a quote by Otl Aicher’s: “Good Art Inspires, Good Design Motivates”. Here you can see part of the design process, with some tweaks and final adjustments.

For our t-shirt we chose a very well known quote that inspires us day by day at work: Done is Better than Perfect. In this case, we started with some paper sketches and then its design:

And last, but not least, our tote bag, which design was inspired by our day-to-day work and methodology. We made some illustrations and then created a final composition.
