## Tough Love

One of the first things that a journeyman programmer will have to
learn when they transition from full time student to working developer
is that things in the real world are _never_ as cut and dry as their
classes may have made it seem. At the end of the day, software is not
written because we love building castles of logic in the sky, it's
written to solve a real problem. That might seem like a trite observation,
but it explains almost everything you observe as a working developer.

Because perfection isn't profitable, real world applications are
developed under less than ideal circumstances, often under intense
pressure, and with inevitable compromises. Large applications sprawl,
get messy, and develop stagnant corners and scary basements.
Questionable or just plain puzzling decisions are made by developers
without explanation, justification, or documentation by developers who
then leave the company, never to be seen or heard from again. Most
junior developers are scared of making mistakes - imagine their
surprise when they find themselves working on something that was
written by another junior developer who did, in fact, make some major
mistakes - mistakes that are now their responsibility to fix.

## Social Skills

People who don't work in the software industry are often surprised to
hear just how intensely sociable it is. Despite internet and software
services being a major, established part of people's everyday lives
for two decades at this point, the old stereotype of the asocial
programmer still has major cultural currency. Rest assured, if you're
thinking of programming as a career because you think you'll get to
sit in front of your computer and never have to deal with people, _you
have definitely picked the wrong field_. Another hard truth here is
that technical competency, no matter how high level, is still a
commodity - no matter how good you are, there are plenty of other
developers out there who are at least that good. Thus the old saw
about it not being what you know, but who you know, is still true even
in a supposedly knowledge oriented field. Also, keeping your skills
up to date will mean more than a few conferences and user group
meetups throughout your career - events that are, by default, social
events. Be prepared to do a lot of (human to human) networking.

On a more day to day level, a developer who can't communicate clearly
and professionally with their peers and co-workers is not going to
keep their job for long. Good developers command good salaries, but
good salaries always come with expectations attached, and one of those
will always be that you can work well in a team and communicate with
others. If someone's going to pay you all of that money, they'll
expect a lot of transparency in return. And that expectation will
only grow as you acquire more and more experience. Your experience
will have value, and your employers will expect you to share that
value with those around you by coaching and mentoring teammates,
_without_ stepping on any toes in the process.

## Stay Humble

It won't take long for a newly minted developer to learn that there
are plenty of developers who have a bit of an ego problem. Aside from
the obvious problems that this can cause with teamwork and
professional behavior, losing perspective in this way can lead to
skills starting to stagnate. When you take on a job as a developer,
whether you realize it or not, you're implicitly taking on another
responsibility - the responsibility of always being a student. The
biggest difference between a newbie developer and a seasoned veteran
is that the senior developer _has been a student for a lot longer._
But remaining a life long student requires you to understand the
difference between confidence and ego, and commit to putting aside
even the slightest shred of ego. Stay open minded, and willing to
consider the possibility that your previous understanding of something
was incomplete or mistaken. Recognize that no matter how much you've
learned, it's only the base for the next thing that you're going to
learn. And realize that no matter how far you've come, you can still
make dumb mistakes - and program accordingly. In a field full of big
personalities, stand out by staying humble.
