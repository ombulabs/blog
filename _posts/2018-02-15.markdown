We recently completed work with [Power HRG](https://powerhrg.com) on a Rails upgrade for their self-described “monolith CRM/ERP application”, and were able to speak to them about their experience with Ombu Labs.

We talked to [Ben Langfeld](https://www.linkedin.com/in/benlangfeld/), lead software engineer at [Power HRG](https://powerhrg.com), about the work on their app, Nitro. According to Ben, their monolithic CRM/ERP application is continuously built by a team of approximately 50 developers, system administrators, testers and support staff. The application contains *over 500,000 lines of Ruby on Rails and Javascript code*, and by their own definition, is one of the more complex Rails applications out there in terms of scope.

Like many companies, Power HRG was having difficulty allocating developer attention to the Rails upgrade project because of the demands of feature work coming from other areas of the business. That is why they decided to come to Ombu Labs for help.

We executed a **full upgrade of the application from Rails 4.0 to 5.1** and prepared the company for an eventual 5.2 upgrade. This necessary upgrade of their application led to a “reduction of risk in terms of repeat bugfix/feature development work compared to what is available in a more modern stack.”

According to Ben, “Ombu augmented our in-house team with a specific capacity for the upgrade project, **enabling our other developers to retain focus on direct business goals**.” Ombu Labs' exclusive focus on the Rails upgrade allowed the developers at [Power HRG](https://powerhrg.com) to continue their work on features and other goals without distractions. In the end, [Power HRG](https://powerhrg.com) received an application with up-to-date Rails versions and was able to make progress on their other work as well.
