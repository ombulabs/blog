Often times I find myself working out of a coffee shop with a **terrible Internet connection**. We have a nice office at [OmbuLabs](https://es.foursquare.com/v/ombushop-hq/52f0e47311d25da04d101b62) but there is still that *Je ne sais quoi* at coffee shops.

The cool thing about [Git](https://git-scm.com/) is that you can `git commit` all your changes while enjoying a cup of coffee and `git push` later (when you're back at home with a decent connection)

But what if you want to `git push` from the coffee shop? Sometimes the only ports that are open are port 80 (HTTP) and 443 (HTTPS).

If your Git remote repository supports HTTPS, you can easily push to it by following these steps:

    git remote add origin-https https://github.com/DatabaseCleaner/database_cleaner.git
    git push origin-https master

A Git repository can have as many remote repositories as you want, so I like to keep `origin` and `origin-https` to `git push` whenever I want.

You will have to enter your username and password to authenticate with Github.

    $ git push origin-https master
    Username for 'https://github.com': etagwerker
    Password for 'https://etagwerker@github.com':
    Everything up-to-date

Now you can `git push` even on shitty Internet connections.
