Today we are happy to announce the launch of our first productized service: [fastruby.io](https://fastruby.io) - Speedy Ruby on Rails Upgrades by OmbuLabs.

We are quite familiar with this sort of projects and decided to package it under its own domain. We have been doing [Ruby on Rails](http://rubyonrails.org) upgrades since 2009, for our [own products](https://www.ombulabs.com/#products) and [client projects](https://www.ombulabs.com/#clients), and we are looking forward to shipping more of them.

If you have been using [Rails](http://rubyonrails.org) for a while, you know that big version jumps are hard. If you have a big Rails [monolith](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/MonolithFirst.html) with 100+ dependencies, you know that [upgrading Rails](https://fastruby.io) is not a trivial project.

You know you need to keep your Rails app **up to date**, but it's usually *not* a priority. So you postpone upgrading until your version of Rails is **no longer supported**. Then you upgrade.

More often than not, you start a [Rails upgrade](https://fastruby.io) branch, start bumping versions, find problems, troubleshoot them, and eventually get sidetracked by your business. Then you switch to another branch and the [Rails upgrade](https://fastruby.io) branch grows stale.

Even the best teams have this problem! (e.g. [Github](http://shayfrendt.com/posts/upgrading-github-to-rails-3-with-zero-downtime/))

That's why we decided to create [fastruby.io](https://fastruby.io). If you don't have the time, but you have the budget to do the **Rails Upgrade**, you can [just contact us](http://fastruby.io/#contact-us) and **we can help**.
