At [Ombu Labs](https://www.ombulabs.com) we believe that if we are not learning from our mistakes we are
doing it wrong. It is simple: *The only unforgivable mistake is to not learn
from our mistakes.*

That is why we try to incorporate feedback into everything we do. We
embrace [peer reviews](https://www.slideshare.net/ombulabs/peer-reviews-44220969) and
[pair programming](https://www.ombulabs.com/blog/agile/pair-programming/joys-and-woes-of-pair-programming.html)
as a way to get constant feedback on a daily basis. _Even this article_ had reviews
from 3 different people! ([https://github.com/ombulabs/blog/pull/154](https://github.com/ombulabs/blog/pull/154))

Another step that we incorporate into every client relationship is an exit
call. This call gives us an opportunity to assess how well we performed.

If we performed well: Great! What can we do more of? If we performed poorly: What
can we improve? What can we do to make it better for our next project?

## Exit Call Questions

Here are some of the questions that we like to ask:

- How was it doing business with us?

- Is there anything we could have done differently?

- What did you _like_ about our service?

- What did you _dislike_ about our service?

- What did you think about our [Rails upgrade](https://www.ombulabs.com/blog/tags/upgrades) process?
Is there anything we can do to improve it?

- Did the team communicate effectively? Was our communication with you and your team effective?

- Did we meet your expectations?

- Was there anything you didn't particularly like?

- How would you have done things differently?

- Would you work with us again? (In a scale from 1 to 10)

These questions should be the beginning of the conversation. If they respond with
short answers, try to dig deeper. Don't settle for an awkward silence or a _yes/no_
answer. Try to ask follow-up questions about their initial answer.

## Conclusion

Exit calls have been a great way to learn from our relationships with clients.
We have written a few case studies based on these exit calls. For example:
[Upgrading a Huge Monolith from Rails 4.0 to 5.1](https://www.ombulabs.com/blog/rails/upgrades/case-study/upgrading-a-monolith.html)

Our secret sauce for our productized [Rails upgrade service](https://fastruby.io) ([https://fastruby.io](https://fastruby.io))
is constantly changing, getting better with every project we ship. Exit calls are
the best way to keep improving as a company.
