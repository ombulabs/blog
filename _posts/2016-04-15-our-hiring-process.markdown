This is our process to hire new team members at [Ombu Labs](https://www.ombulabs.com). It's a process that we have been improving ever since we started our operations. It's **very important** for us to hire **A players**.

In this article I will focus on how we evaluate new developers, but parts of the process can be customized for other positions.

We usually hire Junior and Senior developers. You can find our open positions [over here](https://www.ombulabs.com/jobs).

## How to Apply

You can just follow the _Apply_ link for the position that you are interested in.

We don't want to receive an old school resume. We prefer to receive a link to your [Github](http://github.com) or [LinkedIn](http://linkedin.com), in that particular order.

I realize that there are great developers that have never made any open source contributions. If that's your case, we will ask for a couple of code samples.

We want to see some recent code samples and evaluate you based on your work, not on your work history. **Experience** is important but **passion** is more important.

## Non Technical Interview

If we like what we see, we will send you an email to coordinate an initial interview.

In this interview we will talk about your experience, what you are passionate about, what you are looking for, what we are looking for, and some concepts that are really important to us.

In this stage we want to get a sense of what you are looking for and if we are a **good fit for you**.

Now is a good time to ask all your questions about the company and the position you're interviewing for.

## Technical Interview

If we like what you said on the initial interview, we will send you an new invitation to talk with one of our senior developers.

In this conversation we will talk about your work experience, the interesting things you've worked on, the technologies you are interested in. We will ask you some technical and random questions.

In this stage we want to get a sense of your level of knowledge and see if it matches what we are looking for.

## Paid Pair Programming Time

If we like what you said in the interview, we are going to schedule some time to **pair program** with you.

We don't expect you to work on a test project for free. That's why we will pay for the time that you spend pair programming with us.

We will start a project from scratch and pair program with you from 8 to 16 hours. You will be driving most of the time, but one of us will be your copilot.

In this test, we want you to work as you usually work. You can use [Google](http://www.google.com), [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com), [Rubydoc](https://www.ruby-lang.org/), or whatever you need to get things done.

You will spend some time working with each developer in our team. We want to see **how we work together** and if there is **chemistry** between us.

## Culture Fit Interview

If we like what you did pair programming with us, we will call you in for a **culture fit** interview.

This interview will be an interview with everyone in the team, not just developers. Everyone in the company will be able to ask you one or more questions. They are usually pretty random.

Also, you will be able to ask anyone in the team any questions. This is a good way for you to find out what it's really like to work at Ombu Labs.

## Job Offer

If you pass the culture fit interview, you will receive a job offer.

In the best scenario, you will accept our job offer and join us as soon as possible!

## Join us!

We are very careful when adding people to our team. We want to work with the best talent out there.

We don't want to waste anyone's time. That's why our hiring process is **so long**. In order to keep our team's quality high, we prefer to spend more time than usual making a decision.
