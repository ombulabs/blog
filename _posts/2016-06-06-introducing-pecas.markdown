At [Ombu Labs](https://www.ombulabs.com) we are big fans and happy customers
of [Freckle](https://letsfreckle.com/). We use their widget to track all the
hours that we spend on client projects,
[open source](https://www.ombulabs.com/#open-source) development, and
[our own products](https://www.ombulabs.com/#products).

Today I'm happy to introduce [Pecas, time tracking leaderboards for Freckle](http://ombulabs.github.io/pecas/)! **Pecas** is an
[open source](http://github.com/ombulabs/pecas) tool that integrates with your
account and generates beautiful leaderboards per project and per teammate.

Here is a sample dashboard for all your projects:

On top of that, it will send you an *email alert* if you haven't tracked any hours
during a work day. If it's a holiday, it won't bother you. :)

I like to check it out every week to see if we are on track for our [time and material](https://www.ombulabs.com/blog/software-development/time-and-material.html)
projects. We need to work 40 hours per week for some of our clients and it's a
good way to detect deviations.

To build this small application we decided to use
[Rails 4.2](http://rubyonrails.org/) and the
[Freckle API v2](http://developer.letsfreckle.com/#overview). You can easily
set it up using [Heroku](http://heroku.com) and your Freckle API key: [https://github.com/ombulabs/pecas#first-time-only](https://github.com/ombulabs/pecas#first-time-only)

If you like [Freckle](https://letsfreckle.com) as much as we do, feel free to
**fork Pecas** in [Github](https://github.com/ombulabs): [https://github.com/ombulabs/pecas](https://github.com/ombulabs/pecas)
