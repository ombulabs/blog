At [Ombu Labs](https://www.ombulabs.com) we have many values that have been key
to our success. This is an article about five core values that differentiate 
our company from the rest.

Every team member is expected to follow these values, especially when things get 
tough. This is a living document: It's open source and open to enhancements. We 
have been tweaking these values ever since I started the company.

## Team First

We can't run a successful consultancy if we donâ€™t value and respect every team 
member. We don't want people who "live to work". Workaholism is toxic and it 
leads to burnout. We strive to maintain a healthy work/life balance, to "work 
to live" a great life, and to grow as professionals within the company.

In terms of our communication, we adhere to the contributor covenant v2.0, not 
just for our open source projects, but also for any interaction we have with 
team members: [CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)

## Challenging Projects over Profitable Projects

We value interesting challenges more than high-paying contracts. We are in the 
problem-solving business for real companies. We won't work on _cool-sounding 
solutions_ looking for a problem that doesn't exist. We will only work with 
businesses and entrepreneurs who have real problems. The only way to be great 
problem solvers is to understand and believe in our clients' businesses.

## Talent is Everywhere

The value of our team will always be higher than the sum of the value of each 
team member. There is value in team synergy and our interactions. In sports, 
team play beats raw talent every time. This applies equally in our work 
environment.

We won't let geographical boundaries stop us from hiring the best person for 
the job. As long as our team members can communicate properly, distance won't 
be an issue.

There is great value in diversity and we must strive to foster a diverse 
workforce.

## Open by Default

Everything we do should be open by default. We want to have open communications, 
contribute to open source projects, give back to our communities, and become 
thought-leaders in our industry. Opennes is key to our leadership. When starting
a project, we should ask ourselves: "Is there any reason to make this a closed
source project?"

## Continuous Improvement

We are here to pay off technical debt and invest in our clients' assets. We will 
always strive to leave legacy systems in better shape than when we  started 
working on them.

This does not simply apply to code. It also applies to our clients' culture,
processes, dependencies, code coverage, documentation, best practices, and 
anything that will make our client's life easier in the long term.

We are here to learn from our mistakes. The only unforgivable mistake is to 
not learn from our mistakes.

# Onwards

These values are not written in stone. They are part of an open source project
which will continue to evolve as our culture, people, and leadership evolves.
