We have been using Slack at [OmbuLabs](https://www.ombulabs.com) for a while now
after switching from HipChat, and haven't looked back. It looks and feels much
better than any other available platform of its kind. Slack provides
[WebHooks](https://api.slack.com/incoming-webhooks), which you can use to post
messages to your team's channels.

We use [Solano CI](https://www.solanolabs.com) (formerly Tddium) for our
automated builds. By default, the system sends e-mails whenever a build passes
or fails, but we wanted to be notified in our Slack channels. Enter the
[slack-notify](https://github.com/sosedoff/slack-notify) gem, which makes
Slack notifications super simple in Ruby.

To get started, first
[set up an incoming webhook](https://my.slack.com/services/new/incoming-webhook).

Once that's done, you can create the Rake task which Solano can run when
the build has finished running:

```ruby
  def current_branch
    `git symbolic-ref HEAD 2>/dev/null | cut -d"/" -f 3-`.strip
  end

  task :post_build_hook do
    require 'slack-notify'

    webhook_url = "https://hooks.slack.com/services/your-hook"
    base_url = "#{ENV['TDDIUM_API_SERVER']}"
    session_id = "#{ENV['TDDIUM_SESSION_ID']}"
    build_status = "#{ENV['TDDIUM_BUILD_STATUS']}"

    client = SlackNotify::Client.new(channel: "#your-channel",
                                     webhook_url: webhook_url,
                                     username: "Solano CI",
                                     icon_emoji: ":shipit:")
    msg = "_#{current_branch}_ *#{build_status}*! "
    msg << "Check build details at: "
    msg << "http://#{base_url}/1/reports/#{session_id}"
    client.notify(msg)
  end
```

This will let #your-channel know the branch for which the build ran, whether it passed,
failed or errored, and a link to the build report.

You also need to explicitly call it after the build is finished in your
`solano.yml` or `tddium.yml` file:

```yaml
:tddium:
  :hooks:
    :post_build: RAILS_ENV=test bundle exec rake tddium:post_build_hook
```

We have also set up deployment notifications, so whenever someone deploys to
production, the Slack channel is notified:

```ruby
namespace :notify do
  task :start, roles: [:app] do
    msg = "#{USERNAME} started deploying #{REPO} (#{GIT_TAG}) to production"
    notify_slack(msg)
  end

  task :done, roles: [:app] do
    msg = "#{USERNAME} just deployed #{REPO} (#{GIT_TAG}) to production"
    notify_slack(msg)
  end
end

before "deploy", "notify:start"
after "deploy", "notify:done"
```

There are many different use cases, just make sure not to spam your team with
too many notifications. At some point, you may want to set up a
channel dedicated solely to notifications if you are part of a bigger team.
